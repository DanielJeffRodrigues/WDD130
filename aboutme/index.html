        <p>Greetings brothers and sisters, I am Daniel Jefferson.</p>
        <p>I'm from SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil (land of drizzle).
        I was born and raised in the gospel, served in the Kingston Jamaica Mission and the Fortaleza East Mission (Brazil).</p>
        
        <P>Currently, I am studying Computer Science at a Brazilian university and this semester I am developing a project in Java.</P>

        <p>I like to read fiction books, play video games and run in parks,
        (Despite living in Brazil, in my city there is almost no nature, only buildings :c ). </p>
        
        <P>I'm looking forward to the semester and
        I want to meet you all, I know you will be an example for me.</p>
